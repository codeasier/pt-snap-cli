"""Regression tests for the ``memory_peak`` template rewrite.

The CTE-based rewrite must produce byte-identical results to the original
nested-subquery form for every ``start_id`` / ``end_id`` combination --
including ``null`` and edge cases such as inverted or out-of-range windows.
These guard against regressions in the SQL itself as well as in the
``QueryService`` -> ``QueryExecutor`` integration that drives it.
